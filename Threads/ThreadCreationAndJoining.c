/*
Notes:
pthread_create() is used to create threads. It takes four parameters:
A pointer to the thread identifier (pthread_t).
Thread attributes (set to NULL to use default attributes).
A pointer to the function the thread will execute (thread_function()).
An argument to the thread function (&thread1_id and &thread2_id).
pthread_join() waits for a thread to finish execution. This is important to ensure the main thread doesnâ€™t terminate before the threads complete.
The program creates two threads, each printing a message, and then waits for both threads to finish.
