# Process Management and Threading Fundamentals

This README provides a deep and comprehensive overview of **Process Management** and **Threading Fundamentals**, which are cornerstones of operating system design and concurrent programming. This document covers the theoretical underpinnings, key distinctions, lifecycle states, and coding examples in C and C++ for practical insights.

In Linux, processes and threads are managed using kernel data structures and mechanisms such as task_struct, sched_entity, and system calls like fork, clone, and exec. This section introduces how Linux implements multitasking through these abstractions.

## Introduction

Modern computing systems support multiple programs running simultaneously, which is achieved through **processes** and **threads**. These abstractions allow the operating system (OS) to efficiently manage resources and provide a multitasking environment.

### Why Learn This?
- **Processes** enable isolation, fault tolerance, and secure execution of programs.
- **Threads** provide lightweight, efficient parallelism within a single process.
- Understanding their lifecycle and behavior is critical for system programming, debugging, and optimizing performance.

## Processes vs Threads

### Processes

A **process** is a self-contained unit of execution with its own memory space, file descriptors, and resources. It operates independently, making it suitable for running distinct programs.

- **Example**: Running a web browser and a media player simultaneously involves separate processes.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Isolation**: Processes do not share memory. One process crashing doesn’t affect another.
- **Resource-intensive**: Creating a process requires duplicating memory structures.
- **Communication**: Inter-process communication (IPC) methods like shared memory, pipes, or sockets are needed.

---

### Threads

A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads within the same process share the same memory space but execute independently.

- **Example**: A web browser may have threads for rendering, fetching resources, and handling user input.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Shared Memory**: Threads share the process’s heap and global memory.
- **Efficient**: Threads are faster to create and switch between compared to processes.
- **Interdependence**: A crash in one thread can potentially bring down the entire process.

### Processes in Linux:
Linux uses the fork() system call to create a new process. This creates a near-identical copy of the parent process (child inherits the memory, file descriptors, etc.).
The exec() family of system calls replaces the process's memory space with a new program.
### Threads in Linux:
Linux implements threads as lightweight processes using the clone() system call.
Threads created via pthread_create() use clone() under the hood.
All threads of a process share the same PID namespace, but each thread has its own Thread ID (TID).
### Thread Library:
The POSIX thread library (pthread) is the standard threading library in Linux.

Linux Kernel Threads:
Kernel threads are managed by the kernel and are not associated with a user process. Examples include kworker threads.

### Detailed Comparison

| Feature                 | Process                               | Thread                               |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Independent program in execution.    | Lightweight unit within a process.  |
| **Memory Space**        | Separate.                            | Shared among threads.               |
| **Communication**       | Requires IPC.                        | Direct access to shared data.       |
| **Creation Time**       | Slower (heavy resource allocation).  | Faster (lightweight).               |
| **Context Switching**   | Slower (more data to save/restore).  | Faster.                             |

## Process Control Block (PCB) and Thread Control Block (TCB)

### Process Control Block (PCB)

The **PCB** is a data structure used by the OS to manage process information. It contains all the details required to track and control a process.

#### Key Components:
1. **Identification**: Process ID (PID) and parent PID.
2. **State Information**: Current state (Ready, Running, Waiting).
3. **CPU Context**: Register values, program counter.
4. **Memory Management**: Details like base and limit registers, page tables.
5. **I/O Status**: Open files, I/O device assignments.
6. **Scheduling Info**: Priority, timeslices used.

---

### Thread Control Block (TCB)

The **TCB** is similar to the PCB but operates at a thread level. It tracks individual threads within a process.

#### Key Components:
1. **Thread ID**: Unique identifier for the thread.
2. **State**: Runnable, running, waiting, or terminated.
3. **Program Counter**: Tracks the thread's current instruction.
4. **Stack Pointer**: Points to the thread’s private stack.
5. **Thread-Specific Data**: For thread-local storage.

---

## Context Switching Mechanisms

### What is Context Switching?

When the CPU switches from one process or thread to another, it performs a **context switch**. This involves saving the current state and loading the state of the next entity to run.

### Steps in Context Switching:
1. **Save State**: The OS saves the current process’s/thread’s registers, program counter, and stack pointer into its PCB/TCB.
2. **Scheduler Invocation**: The OS selects the next process/thread to execute based on scheduling algorithms.
3. **Restore State**: Registers, program counter, and stack pointer of the selected process/thread are loaded.

### Hardware and OS Role
- **Timer Interrupts**: CPUs use timer interrupts to preempt the running task and trigger the scheduler.
- **Hardware Support**: Modern CPUs provide privileged instructions to optimize state saving/restoration.

---

### Optimizations
1. **Kernel Threads**: OS-managed threads reduce user-to-kernel switching overhead.
2. **Lightweight Context Switching**: Some systems use cooperative multitasking to minimize state saves.

## Process States and Lifecycle

Processes undergo multiple states during their lifecycle. The OS manages these transitions to optimize resource usage.

### States:
1. **New**: The process is being created.
2. **Ready**: The process is ready to run but is waiting for CPU allocation.
3. **Running**: The process is currently executing on the CPU.
4. **Blocked/Waiting**: The process is waiting for an external event (e.g., I/O).
5. **Terminated**: The process has completed execution.

### State Transitions
- **Ready → Running**: When the scheduler assigns CPU time.
- **Running → Waiting**: When waiting for I/O or resources.
- **Waiting → Ready**: When the event is completed.

---

## Thread States and Lifecycle

Threads share similar lifecycle states as processes but differ in granularity. A thread can be:
1. **New**: Created but not yet scheduled.
2. **Runnable**: Ready to execute.
3. **Running**: Actively executing on a CPU core.
4. **Blocked**: Waiting for a resource or synchronization.
5. **Terminated**: Completed its task.

---

### Multithreading Models

- **User-Level Threads**: Managed entirely by the user application, without OS support.
- **Kernel-Level Threads**: Managed by the OS kernel, allowing true parallelism.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combine user-level and kernel-level threading advantages.

---

## Coding Examples

### Example 1: Forking a New Process
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child Process: PID = %d\n", getpid());
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        printf("Parent Process: PID = %d, Child PID = %d\n", getpid(), pid);
    } else {
        perror("Fork failed");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Example 2: Multi-threading in C++ with `std::thread`
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void threadTask() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Thread executing\n";
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(threadTask);
    std::thread t2(threadTask);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    std::cout << "Main thread finished\n";
    return 0;
}
```
