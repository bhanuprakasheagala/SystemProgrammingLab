## Introduction

Systems programming involves low-level software development, focusing on operating system functionality, network communication, and embedded systems. This repository provides a platform to explore and experiment with these concepts through hands-on coding exercises and projects.

## OS Concepts

### System Calls Implementation

Understanding system calls is crucial for interacting with the operating system kernel. In this section, we implement various system calls to perform tasks such as file I/O, process management, and inter-process communication.

### Scheduling Algorithms

Schedulers play a vital role in managing system resources efficiently. Here, we explore different scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling, implementing and analyzing their performance.

### Concurrency and IPC Mechanisms

Concurrency and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms enable multiple processes to execute simultaneously and communicate with each other. We delve into concepts like threads, mutexes, semaphores, and message queues, implementing them to solve synchronization problems.

### Virtual Memory Concepts

Virtual memory abstraction provides processes with a larger address space than physical memory. This section covers concepts such as demand paging, page replacement algorithms, and memory mapping, implementing them to manage memory efficiently.

### File System Management

File systems organize and store data on storage devices, facilitating efficient data access and manipulation. Here, we explore file system structures, directory operations, file permissions, and disk management, implementing a basic file system.

## Network Programming

Networking is essential for communication between distributed systems. This section covers socket programming, TCP/IP protocols, UDP communication, and network security concepts, implementing various network applications and protocols.

## Embedded Programming

Embedded systems programming involves developing software for specialized computing devices. Here, we delve into embedded systems architecture, bare-metal programming, device drivers, and real-time operating systems (RTOS), implementing projects for embedded platforms.
